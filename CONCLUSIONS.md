# CONCLUSIONS
Despite experimenting with various models, I found that the features I obtained were not very predictive of house prices. Of my models K_means clustering appeared to be the best model for predicting the price, I believe this to be because houses with similar prices will cluster in an area making it more likely a neighbor of a high priced home will also most likely be high price. Predicting the price of real estate likely requires more comprehensive data, such as property value, property condition, acreage of the property, date of construction, and prices of other houses in the neighborhood.
