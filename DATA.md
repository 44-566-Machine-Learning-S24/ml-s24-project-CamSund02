## Exploration
Within [initial exploration](https://github.com/44-566-Machine-Learning-S24/ml-s24-project-CamSund02/blob/master/.ipynb_checkpoints/initial_exploration-checkpoint.ipynb) you can find the feautes and first few values within my first dataset. You can also view my linear regression of the first data set [Linear Regression](https://github.com/44-566-Machine-Learning-S24/ml-s24-project-CamSund02/blob/master/.ipynb_checkpoints/linear_regression-checkpoint.ipynb)

Within my second dataset ZillowScrape4.10.24 I found 4 features: latitude, longitued, floorSize and price. You can view this within the output of my second python cell in my [Models Notebook](https://github.com/44-566-Machine-Learning-S24/ml-s24-project-CamSund02/blob/master/Notebooks/Models.ipynb).


## Transformations
I performed a PCA dimension reduction within my [Models Notebook](https://github.com/44-566-Machine-Learning-S24/ml-s24-project-CamSund02/blob/master/Notebooks/Models.ipynb), this can be found within the K-means Clustering section being the second model that I used in the notebook. You can also find my initial linear regresssion model here as well, being my first model used in my [Models Notebook](https://github.com/44-566-Machine-Learning-S24/ml-s24-project-CamSund02/blob/master/Notebooks/Models.ipynb).
