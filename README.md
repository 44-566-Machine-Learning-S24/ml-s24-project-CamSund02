## Overview
For this project my initial goal was to predict the price of a house based off a few key features.

I initally was hoping to use a Zillow data set or api to access real world housing data for Northwest Missouri. I was unable to do this at first, further explanation in [RAW_DATA](RAW_DATA.md).

I found out that after using a few models to try to preidct the price of houses, the data and features that I picked as predicors were not very representative of a house's price.
